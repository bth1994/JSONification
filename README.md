# JSONification [WIP]

###lab objectives
* most popular JSON lib for java
* demonstrate the 5 most common operations
* optional: write tests
* optional: write project desc.

###action tracker
* import [Jackson](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind) maven dependency  
* 

###5 most common JSON operations
* CRUD 
    + **create** a JSONObject from java Object
        + at least 2 nesting layers
        + at least one array
    + **read** JSON string from an incoming source and parse it to JSONObject
        + check for null 
        + at least one array
        + compare JSON objects based on a nested field 
    + **update** the previously read object
        + change at least 3 values
    + **delete** values from previously read object
        + remove an array
        + remove an object
        
* Jackson Annotations are fair game
* change field name/ ignore properties on serialization
* 
###understanding JSON
* store JSON data
* store JSON data in Array
* nesting data
* objects vs arrays
* why is JSON important

###pile
* build a JSON java object
    call stuff on it
    output as text
    maybe to file
